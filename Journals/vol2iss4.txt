Introduction
</H1>

<H2>
When writing to Henri Bortoft about coming to a workshop we were doing on Paradox, 
he replied with an article 'The Transformative Potential of Paradox'. Together with Chris 
Clarke article 'Is the Universe in a State of Pilgrimage ' from a previous seminar at Birkbeck, 
we had the making of a journal! The issue asks 'What is Holistic Science?' Some excellent student 
essays, a thesis description by Adam Croft, an article by Stephan Harding added to the rich content. 
The issue is dedicated to Brian Goodwin and reprints his article on Darwin . Philip Franses' editorial 
is named as Ariadne's Thread, the title Brian was keen on for the Holistic Science Journal, he imagined. 
Satish Kumar wrote on 'Knowledge and Wisdom'. So First Light was born.
