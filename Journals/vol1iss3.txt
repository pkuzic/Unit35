Introduction
</H1>

<H2>
The issue KNOWING brings together for the first time Henri Bortoft, 
Emilios Bouratinos and Iain McGilchrist. Each has explored wholeness 
from their own unique perspective: Henri Bortoft through Goethe and 20th 
century philosophy; Emilios Bouratios through ancient Greek culture and 
modern science; Iain McGilchrsit through English literature and pyschology; 
each have understood wholeness along different paths, 
that are now in this issue brought together. So a process of Knowing 
is contrasted with certain objective knowledge. This is also investigated 
in fields of biosemiotics, hermeneutics and physics, as well as reports from 
the field.
