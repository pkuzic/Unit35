Introduction
</H1>

<H2>
<i>Dynamic Wholeness</i> is a tribute to philosopher Henri Bortoft and his extraordinary work 
into a participatory way of seeing. In Basil Hiley's article 'The Arithmetic of Wholeness', 
the different type of logic promoted by Henri Bortoft in his philosophy is followed for its 
implications in modern physics. The approach provides a bridge from our experience of being in 
the world to how we interpret the foundations of physics.

Mathematically we can take non-numerical formative logic as the basis of physics. 
Philosophically we can interpret this logical approach as an engagement with meaning. Taken 
together, the mathematics and the philosophy imply that in the suspension of logical analysis, 
a dimension of practical engagement arises that carries its own dynamic of meaning.

The issue also brings together many people who knew, worked with or applied Henri's ideas 
over various periods of his life.  Articles and papers are drawn from all periods of Henri Bortoft's 
life, working with David Bohm and Basil Hiley at Birkbeck College , then with JG Bennett, starting his 
work on Goethean Science, coming to Schumacher College where he taught for fourteen years laying the 
foundation of the Holistic Science course.
